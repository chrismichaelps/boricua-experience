# View.Components.Search

> /** @View.Components.Search.Controls — the search pill, category chips, and the filter bar */

## Purpose

The white search pill (what, where, when, round submit, suggestions list), scrolling category chips, and the GET filter bar.

## Interface

### Signatures

```pudu
export fn windowLabel, categoryName, pill, chips, filterBar
```

### Linkage

- **Requires:** `Std.Html.Build`, [[src/View/Frame]], [[src/I18n/Translate]], Domain types.
- **Consumed by:** Web handlers and other views.

## Algorithm

Builds `Html` values with the trait chain; text from requests or the database goes through `says`, never `raw`.

## Negative Logic (Prohibited Paths)

- ❌ No service calls: a view renders what it is given.
- ❌ No inline scripts; behaviour attaches by `data-feature`.

## Edge Cases

- Every interactive control has a visible label or `aria-label`; touch targets are at least 44 px.

## Depth

MEDIUM.

## Grill Log

- **Q:** How do the app-style search controls preserve filtering?
  **A:** Native named selects remain the submission source and no-script fallback. Progressive picker dialogs expose a searchable municipality list and existing date windows with translated labels, keyboard dismissal and focus restoration. Pill submission retains category, free, sort and coordinates. Version 7 refreshes entry/styles; unchanged carousel modules keep their version 3 imports.

- **Q:** How does the reference-inspired refresh preserve behaviour?
  **A:** A decorative cotorra appears above the shared pill; form names, labels, autocomplete and GET submission remain unchanged.


- **Q:** Templates or values?
  **A:** Values: a page is an `Html` tree, so escaping cannot be forgotten and pages are testable with fixtures.

## Referenced by

[[src/_MOC]]

Independent review resolutions: Enter inside municipality search selects the first visible choice and never implicitly submits the surrounding form; empty results remain open. Default Soon is omitted to preserve server relevance for text searches. Keyboard-visible focus restores the segment outline.

## Parrot/privacy continuation
Use original cotorra puertorriqueña SVG assets and optional Motion privacy disclosure without changing native checkbox submission. Grill: local assets and progressive enhancement preserve behavior; resolved.

## Brand refresh contract
Original compact parrot replaces the former mascot. Brand asset URLs use shared version20; changed entry/styles/Motion refresh together while unchanged map imports retain their single version19 identity. Grill: named links and native search semantics are preserved; resolved.
