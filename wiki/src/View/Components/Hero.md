# Hero

## Purpose

A static first-slide hero, cotorra search form, caption link, four labelled dot buttons and a pause control. Decorative images are hidden from assistive technology.

## Interface

hero(frame, catalog) / heroCarousel(node), wired by data-feature="hero-carousel".

## Algorithm

Server emits the first scene and functional search. The browser rotates only backgrounds and the caption; search/navigation stay fixed. Selected dot uses aria-pressed. Each image must decode before activation; stale asynchronous selections are discarded.

## Negative Logic

No moving focus, live-region announcement every six seconds, remote image loading, personal data or inline scripts. No automatic motion with prefers-reduced-motion.

## Edge Cases

No JavaScript (first image and search work), failed image decode, rapid dot clicks, page hidden, keyboard focus, hover, explicit pause, reduced-motion change.

## Depth

MEDIUM: presentation boundaries; Constants are shallow immutable data.

## Grill Log

- **Q:** Does the entire hero move?
  **A:** No. Backgrounds crossfade; the cotorra, search form and navigation stay fixed. The caption and selected dot update together.
- **Q:** How does motion stay controllable?
  **A:** A labelled pause button persists user choice. Focus, hover and page hide suspend the timer; reduced-motion preference disables automatic rotation and fades.
- **Q:** How are failed/late image loads handled?
  **A:** Keep the current image until the next decodes. A selection ticket ignores stale completions.
